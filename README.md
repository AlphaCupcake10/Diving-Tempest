# Project DeepDive

## General Idea
There is a building which is only 1 floor above the ground but many floors below the ground and its postapocalypse time and there's one last guy(scientist) alive.
He goes into the building and fights monsters(zombies) and switches between times (past and present) to move down deep into the earth till the final boss.
On the way he also finds fragments of his old memories and he realizes what happened in the past and how to defeat the final boss.

## Gameplay Idea
### Movement/Shooting mechanics
- The player can only shoot in the direction they are looking towards i.e if they are facing left then they can shoot only left if they are facing right then they can only shoot right.
- Player will find new and better weapons on different levels as the story unfolds
- Player can shoot in 3 different trajectories in whatever direction he is facing. <br>

- Player can jump, shoot, walk and run.

### Levels
- Each level can be finished by either solving it in the past by puzzles or fighting the zombies in the present.
- After a few levels there can be a resting level where the player can see some past memories and also pet a stray cat over there.
- For weapons some weapons can drop from zombies, some just show up after solving a puzzle in the past, some are destined to be found in the resting levels.
- Player doesnot have to have all the weapons to defeat the final boss

## ArtStyle
- The entire game will be in pixel art style
- Present will be overgrown apocalyptic style
- Past will be scifi style
- Background can have parallax effects too
