# Project Diving Tempest

## Story
You are a spec-ops commander who just returned to his country, Patria Mea, after 5 years. Thinking you would spend the rest of your life with your family, but you weren't aware that everything has changed. As you arrived, you saw people with weird skin colors walking in a weird manner, which you couldn't understand until your wife was bitten and turned into an aegrotus (infected person).

You had no choice, you decapacitate her. you feel empty and dead inside

Then you ran for your life and were in hiding for almost 5 days until you realized escaping wasn't possible as they were multiplying day by day and were even spreading to other countries, so you think only had one way: either do or die, so you decided you would escape no more. You did some research to find about the source of the aegrotus virus. 

Eureka! you found the origin, It was a Deep Underground Science Facility. You head out to finish it once and for all to seek revenge for your wife
